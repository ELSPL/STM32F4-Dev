* @section section1 Introduction:
*         Having studied this LAB you will able to: \n
*         -   Understand the Core Feature \n
*         -   Study the programs related to Bit Banding feature
*
* @section section2 Example1 :
*    Objective: Write a Program to implement bit banding in SRAM region and Peripheral region.
*
* @section section3 Program Description:
*    This program demonstrates bit banding feature by accessing SRAM and Peripheral Regions.
